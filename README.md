## Overview

The **Azure IoT Device Workbench** is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides an integrated environment to code, build, deploy, and debug your IoT device project with multiple Azure services supported. The extension also supports working with [IoT Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play) by defining *device capability model* schemas and generating skeleton device code and projects.

## Get Started

### Develop device using IoT Plug and Play

[IoT Plug and Play <sup>public preview</sup>](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/) is a *device capability model schema* that describes device capabilities. The Azure IoT Device Workbench extension provides an integrated environment to author IoT Plug and Play *device capability models (DCM)* and *interfaces*, publish to model repositories, and generate skeleton C code to implement the device application.

Learn how to get started with IoT Plug and Play and use the Device Workbench extension to build an IoT Plug and Play device:

- [What is IoT Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play) and the [Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)](https://aka.ms/DTDL) that enables it.
- [Quickstart: Use a device capability model to create an IoT Plug and Play device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/quickstart-create-pnp-device)
- [Build an IoT Plug and Play Preview device that's ready for certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/tutorial-build-device-certification)
- [Use Azure IoT Device Workbench extension in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/howto-develop-with-vs-vscode)
- [Connect an MXChip IoT DevKit device to your Azure IoT Central application via IoT Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-connect-devkit-pnp)

### Develop on generic device

Currently the following device platforms and languages are supported in Azure IoT Device Workbench.

#### Embedded Linux <sup>public preview</sup>

For Embedded Linux devices, the Device Workbench uses container to simplify the cross-compiling tool chain setup and configuration, which means all cross-compiling work happens in the container.

Languages supported: `C/C++`

Devices supported: [Cortex-A series](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-a) devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, NXP i.MX6) that are running embedded Linux such as Debian, Ubuntu or Yocto Linux.

Follow the [setup guide](docs/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-setup.md) to setup the prerequisite including Docker runtime.

Here are a set of tutorials to help you get started:

- [Get Started connect Raspberry Pi to Azure IoT Hub](docs/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-get-started.md)
- [Configure an existing CMake project using containerized toolchain](docs/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-configure-project.md)
- [Develop IoT Plug and Play device using containerized toolchain](docs/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-pnp.md)
- [Customize your device toolchain](docs/embedded-linux/embedded-linux-customization.md)


#### Arduino

Currently, Device Workbench supports MXChip IoT DevKit and ESP32 DevKits using Arduino. For generic Arduino device, we recommend you use [Arduino extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino).

Languages supported: `Arduino C/C++`

Devices supported: [MXChip IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/iot-devkit), [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview).

> The Device Workbench relies on Arduino IDE as a dependency to develop on the above devices. If you have installed Device Workbench prior to Arduino IDE, you may need to restart VS Code to make it find the Arduino IDE installation path correctly.

##### MXChip IoT DevKit

Follow the [setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started#prepare-the-development-environment) to setup the environment including the Arduino extension.

Here are a set of tutorials to help you get started:

- [Get Started connect DevKit to Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-get-started)
- [Use Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service auto-provisioning device with IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/how-to-connect-mxchip-iot-devkit)
- [Connect to the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-accelerators/iot-accelerators-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-devkit-remote-monitoring-v2)
- [Translate voice message with Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/mxchip-iot-devkit-translator/sample/)
- [Send messages to an MQTT server using Eclipse Paho APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/mxchip-iot-devkit-mqtt-client/sample/)

- [DevKit OTA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/mxchip-iot-devkit-firmware-ota/sample/)

##### ESP32

Follow the [setup guide](docs/esp32/esp32-setup.md) to setup ESP32 device including the Arduino extension.

Here are a set of tutorials to help you get started:

- [Get Started connect ESP32 device to Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/esp32-iot-devkit-get-started/sample/)
- [ESP32 State](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/esp32-iot-devkit-state/sample/)
